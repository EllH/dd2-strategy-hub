# Dungeon Defenders 2 Strategy Hub

This is the open source project of the [DD2 Strategy Hub](https://dd2strategyhub.com/) webapp. It is a community driven project to 
provide a platform for the Dungeon Defenders 2 community to optimize their strategies and builds.

You can do some theory crafting, share your builds and strategies, and discuss them with other players.
Besides the strategy hub also contains some useful tools like a reroll tracker which you can use to keep
an eye out for that sweet guaranteed perfect roll and there's a little section which can be useful to
keep at your hands while doing resets; it's a small and easy overview of the floors and their respective
chaos tiers. This could be handy for skipping some floors if you reached the gear score for the next 
chaos and still have 2 or more floors left in your current chaos.

Encounter any issues of maybe you have some suggestions for us to add to the webapp? 
Feel free to let know at the [issues page](https://github.com/kabamgamer/dd2-strategy-hub/issues).

Enjoy!
